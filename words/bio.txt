A self-motivated programmer and Computer Science undergrad doing his senior year at the University of Florida. I'm always interested in learning new technologies and getting involved in projects. Most of my skills are learned and applied outside of the classroom.
Though I routinely go back to languages like Java, my current interests are with web technologies. I'm experienced in various JavaScript frameworks including AngularJS and find myself comfortable working with databases (SQL and NoSQL). I prefer to work on front-end, but back-end development isn't half bad either.
I am an active member of UF AggreGator, the university's representative team for the NASA Annual Robotic Mining Competition (three years running!). I am also the UF Software Development Club (UFSDC) webmaster.
I'm Andrew Vorakrajangthiti, a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Florida. I like to code more than writing personal biographies. I'm often sitting behind a computer of some sort working on a project or watching silly internet videos. Sometimes, I like to go out. Sometimes,
My interests are varied but I often find myself enjoying front-end development using web technologies. Occasionally, I'll revisit my roots and mess around with my long-time pal, Java. 
With a serrated knife, cut the top off the extra bun half, leaving about a 3/4-inch-thick slice. This will be the middle bun of your sandwich. Place the three bun halves on a hot pan or griddle, face down, and toast them to a light brown. Set aside, but keep the pan hot. Divide the ground beef in half and press into two thin patties slightly larger than the bun. Cook the patties in the hot pan over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Salt and pepper lightly. Give me five.
